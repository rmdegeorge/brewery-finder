My app will be a brewery finding app.  It will have a search
bar that will allow the user to search by the name of a 
brewery, or by the location of a brewery. The search results
will populate using data from www.openbrewerydb.org. The user
will be able to select results a and save them to a favorites
list.






Possible functionality I'd like to include is dynamic search results, 
  where it would display top search results as you type in search bar.
  ~filter results by specific distance from a location
Would like to add a show on map function and be able to sort by distance
  Get Directions button (opens new tab for maps.google.com with the brewery pre-populated)
interactive background using particles.js to make it look like bubles in a beer glass.
